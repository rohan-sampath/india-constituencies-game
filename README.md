# India Constituencies Game

A self-challenge to see how quickly I could build a functional (if somewhat limited) application. (Built this in 2 hours flat!)

This application is an ultra-simple constituency guessing game - how many of India's 543 constituencies can you guess? I built this in honour of the [Indian general election, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election) - the largest democratic process the world has seen to date. 

You can play along [here](https://rohan-sampath.github.io/india-constituencies-game/).
